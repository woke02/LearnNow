# LearnNow

### Project Description
LearnNow is a mobile application that features a simple authentication module and enables users to access a list of contents divided into chapters, each containing multiple sections comprising text and images. With LearnNow, users can create an account, log in, and view their progress in completing the sections of each chapter. The app saves user progress locally and displays it through a progress bar. LearnNow is designed to resume from where the user left off the last time they used the app, making it a convenient and efficient tool for learning on the go.
